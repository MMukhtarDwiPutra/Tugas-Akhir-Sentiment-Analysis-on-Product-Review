Item took awhile to be shipped out Ordered on 9 june sent out on 15 june and rec'd on 17 june The package got torn in transit too so that was a huge disappointment and slight anguish Ninja van did not even contact me nor knock on the door and simply left the parcel outside; 0; tech; 4

Though the box came dented.; 0; tech; 3
Lack of protection in the wrapping No bubble wrapping or other means of drop protection Only filmsy plastic envelope partially torn NinjaVan placed the box ON the metal door the box fell from 1.5m height when door was opened Lucky no damage incurred HDD is fast but a bit noisy.; 0; tech; 3
Good product Seller gave a complimentary pouch too The only bad thing to pinpoint is that it is 1.8tb instead of 2tb so I'm shortchanged of 0.2tb which equals to 200gb ): And oh the rose gold looks like silver instead of rose gold.; 1; tech; 4
Haven't yet to test it out box has a few dents on it at the corner and at the side of the box box looks old too like it has been sitting at the shelf for very Long never see this kind of box in the retail store; 0; tech; 3
No protection on product during shipping Just a poly mailer over the product box was thus dented False advertising on 15 day return policy due as change of mind is actually not eligible for electronics Upon changing of mind found out that electronics was not eligible for it BUYERS BEWARE.; 0; tech; 1
I have received the item in good condition Yet to try it Disappointed is it didnt come with hard case or pouch to protect my hard disk whereby I see most comments it actually come with it.; 0; tech; 4
Pouch's fabric was torn (in the middle) Zip is also of bad quality. Wire is also not authentic...; 0; tech; 1
There's no pouch when i received it so the comments can be misleading Enquire seagate on use pouch but no response Product wise is working ok; 0; tech; 3
Seller contacted me on the Black color I ordered being out of stock I asked for Grey instead Ur instead of the grey I asked for I got silver. I've tested the item overall it is good; 1; tech; 4
mylio Adobe Creative cloud item does not get too hot after long use But the use of ninjavan courier made it a terribly poor experience Consider switching courier for better end to end client experience.; 0; tech; 3

did a load test and unfortunately my files seems to be corrupted and I can't even delete my previous file that's seemingly ghosting up the hard disk's space.; 0; tech; 2
But the bad thing is the courier just left the item at my doorstep and never notify us even there's people in the house If lost or stolen there will be a discrepancy Pls tell courier to ensure item is received by family member So worried Pls understand; 0; tech; 3
A little bulkier than expected but works perfectly fine; 1; tech; 4
